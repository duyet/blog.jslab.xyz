* Enter an equation of a chemical reaction and click 'Balance'. The answer will appear below
* Always use the upper case for the first character in the element name and the lower case for the second character. <br />
Examples: `Fe`, `Au`, `Co`, `Br`, `C`, `O`, `N`, `F`.    	Compare: Co - cobalt and CO - carbon monoxide
* To enter an electron into a chemical equation use `{-}` or e
* To enter an ion specify charge after the compound in curly brackets: `{+3}` or `{3+}` or `{3}`.<br />
Example: `Fe{3+} + I{-} = Fe{2+} + I2`
* Substitute immutable groups in chemical compounds to avoid ambiguity. 
* For instance equation `C6H5C2H5 + O2 = C6H5OH + CO2 + H2O` will not be balanced, 
but `XC2H5 + O2 = XOH + CO2 + H2O` will
* Compound states [like (s) (aq) or (g)] are not required.
